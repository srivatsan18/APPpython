        <h2>About Python</h2>
        <div>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
        Python is the most commonly used language and lot of domain applications such as Data Science and Artificial Inteligence have become easy with Python.Although this language is slow compared to C++ and C it offers a lot of packages and easy  is to use. All the more the developer community of python is very active and hence more developments are made using Python.Python also supports many Programming Paradigms and we will discuss them below.

    <div id=structure><h3 id=st>Structural Paradigm</h3>
        Structured programming is a program written with only the three constructions sequence, decision (if..elif statements), and repetition (while or for statements). Important: the body of a Python if, elif, while, or for statement is indicated by indenting four spaces.  Python does not use end statements.

<br><div id=texti>Sequence.
<br>Lines or blocks of code are written and executed in sequential order.</div>
<li>Example:
<br>x = 56
<br>y = 11
<br>z = x + y
<br>print(z)
</li>
<br><div id=texti>Decision.
<br>Execute a block of code (action) if a condition is true. The block of code is executed at most once.</div>
<br>if condition:
<br> action
<li>Example:
<br>if x % 2 == 0:
 <br>print("The number is even.")
</li>
<br>
<div id=texti>Repetition/Iteration.  
<br> Repeat a block of code (action) while a condition is true. There is no limit to the number of times that the block can be executed.</div>
<br>while condition:
    <br>action<br>
<li>Example:
<br>n = 1
<br>while n < 100:
<br>    print(n)
<br>    n = n * n

<div id=pro><h3 id=st>Procedural Paradigm</h3></div>
Tasks are treated as step-by-step iterations where common tasks are placed in functions that are called as needed.This coding style favors iteration, sequencing, selection, and modularization.Python excels in implementing this particular paradigm.
<br>The procedural style relies on procedure calls to create modularized code. This approach simplifies your application code by breaking it into small pieces that a developer can view easily. Even though procedural coding is an older form of application development, it’s still a viable approach for tasks that lend themselves to step-by-step execution. Here’s an example of the procedural coding style using <b>my_list:</b><br>

<div id=oops><h3 id=st>Object Oriented Paradigm</h3></div>
Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.
For instance, an object could represent a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.
<br>class Dog(object):<br>
&emsp;&emsp; pass
<br><ul class="points">
    <li>Object</li>
    <li>Class</li>
    <li>Method</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li>
    <li>Data Abstraction</li>
    <li>Encapsulation</li>
    </ul>
All classes create objects, and all objects contain characteristics called attributes (referred to as properties in the opening paragraph). Use the __init__() method to initialize (e.g., specify) an object’s initial attributes by giving them their default value (or state). This method must have at least one argument as well as the self variable, which refers to the object itself (e.g., Dog).
class Dog:<br>

<br>    # Initializer / Instance Attributes
<br> &emsp;   def __init__(self, name, age):
<br>    &emsp;&emsp;    self.name = name
<br>    &emsp;&emsp;    self.age = age

<div id=event><h3 id=st>Event Driven Paradigm</h3></div>
Event-driven programming focuses on events. Eventually, the flow of program depends upon events. Until now, we were dealing with either sequential or parallel execution model but the model having the concept of event-driven programming is called asynchronous model. Event-driven programming depends upon an event loop that is always listening for the new incoming events. The working of event-driven programming is dependent upon events. Once an event loops, then events decide what to execute and in what order
.<br>Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python.

<br>Creating a GUI application using Tkinter

<br>Steps

<br>Import the Tkinter module.

<br>Import tKinter as tk

<br>Create the GUI application main window.

<br>root = tk.Tk()

<br>Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.

<br>button = tk.Button(root, text='Stop', width=25, command=root.destroy)

<br>button.pack()

<br>Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.

<br>root.mainloop()

<div id=dec><h3 id=st>Declarative Paradigm</h3></div>
Declarative
programming
is
a
programming paradigm that expresses the
logic of
a computation without
describing its
control flow.
This
paradigm
often
considers
programs
as
theories of
a formal
logic,
and computations
as deductions
in
that logic space.

Declarative
programming
is
often
defined
as any style of programming
that
is not
imperative.

Common declarative
languages
include
those of database query
languages (SQL), logic
programming,
functional programming, etc.

<div id=imp><h3 id=st>Imperative Paradigm</h3></div>
The imperative programming paradigm uses the imperative mood of natural language to express directions. It executes commands in a step-by-step manner, just like a series of verbal commands. Following the "how-to-solve" approach, it makes direct changes to the state of the program; hence it is also called the stateful programming model. Using the imperative programming paradigm, you can quickly write very simple yet elegant code, and it is super-handy for tasks that involve data manipulation. Owing to its comparatively slower and sequential execution strategy, it cannot be used for complex or parallel computations.
