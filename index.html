        <h2>About Python</h2>
        <div>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
        Python is the most commonly used language and lot of domain applications such as Data Science and Artificial Inteligence have become easy with Python.Although this language is slow compared to C++ and C it offers a lot of packages and easy  is to use. All the more the developer community of python is very active and hence more developments are made using Python.Python also supports many Programming Paradigms and we will discuss them below.

    <div id=structure><h3 id=st>Structural Paradigm</h3>
        Structured programming is a program written with only the three constructions sequence, decision (if..elif statements), and repetition (while or for statements). Important: the body of a Python if, elif, while, or for statement is indicated by indenting four spaces.  Python does not use end statements.

<br><div id=texti>Sequence.
<br>Lines or blocks of code are written and executed in sequential order.</div>
<li>Example:
<br>x = 56
<br>y = 11
<br>z = x + y
<br>print(z)
</li>
<br><div id=texti>Decision.
<br>Execute a block of code (action) if a condition is true. The block of code is executed at most once.</div>
<br>if condition:
<br> action
<li>Example:
<br>if x % 2 == 0:
 <br>print("The number is even.")
</li>
<br>
<div id=texti>Repetition/Iteration.  
<br> Repeat a block of code (action) while a condition is true. There is no limit to the number of times that the block can be executed.</div>
<br>while condition:
    <br>action<br>
<li>Example:
<br>n = 1
<br>while n < 100:
<br>    print(n)
<br>    n = n * n
</div>
<div id=pro><h3 id=st>Procedural Paradigm</h3></div>
Tasks are treated as step-by-step iterations where common tasks are placed in functions that are called as needed.This coding style favors iteration, sequencing, selection, and modularization.Python excels in implementing this particular paradigm.
<br>The procedural style relies on procedure calls to create modularized code. This approach simplifies your application code by breaking it into small pieces that a developer can view easily. Even though procedural coding is an older form of application development, it’s still a viable approach for tasks that lend themselves to step-by-step execution. Here’s an example of the procedural coding style using <b>my_list:</b><br>
